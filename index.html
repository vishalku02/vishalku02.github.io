          <h3>AmpleGCG-Plus</h3>
          <p>AmpleGCG-Plus is a suite of LLMs for rapidly 'jailbreaking' other LLMs. Our paper shows Llama-2-7B can learn the GCG discrete optimization algorithm, and generalize to any given harmful query. <br><br> Use AmpleGCG-Plus to see if your models are robust to OOD adversarial prompts. </p>

          <h3>Harmony</h3>
          <p>A song recommender system that translates vague feelings into music suggestions. I fine-tuned Gemini to quantify natural language mood descriptions with the Spotify API's song parameters (acousticness, valence, danceability, etc.). The frontend was built out with React/Next.js, and multiple APIs to connect user accounts and visualize songs. <br><br> Harmony was featured in the College of Engineering's Capstone Showcase.</p>

          <p>A reccomendation engine to help newbies navigate the wine market. Somm uses RAG with GPT-4 and Cohere Rerank to convert flavor descriptions to wines suggestions and wine styles. I built the pipeline with LangChain and deployed the model with Shiny. <br><br> Somm won a top project award in a cohort of 500+ PhD students at the Erdos Institute Data Science Bootcamp.</p>

          <h3>Educational Algebra Game</h3>
          <p>A game to help students develop a deep conceptual understanding of arithmetic and algebra. <br><br> Inspired by key works in math education literature: Gray and Tall's <a href="https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/David.Tall/pdfs/dot1991h-gray-procept-pme.pdf">'proceptual' understanding</a>, Sfard's <a href="http://academic.sun.ac.za/mathed/174/GainsAndPitfalls.pdf">'reification'</a>, and Siegler and Braithwaite's <a href="https://siegler.tc.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2017-Siegler-Braithwaite-NumDev.pdf">'gut-level' numerical development</a>. I led design of core mechanics and worked on a few tasks for our rapid prototyping system in Unity using C#. <br><br> Our design and prototype was included as part of an NSF proposal for serious games to foster deep conceptual math understanding.</p>

Implemented the singleton design pattern for player, state design patterns for player and enemy behavior as well as game states, and the factory design pattern for sprites. <br><br> I also added extra content, including new enemies and the Master Sword trials inspired by Breath of the Wild.</p>

          <p>A project under Professor Jordan Tate at UC's NFT Media Lab. <br><br> Developed the minting website for The Prospect Gallery, a free platform for students in the College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning to sell their artwork as NFTs. I used Metaplex's Candy Machine to build the minting functionality and programmed smart contracts to distribute royalties. <br><br> The Prospect Gallery launched successfully with 30+ artworks submitted and 5 pieces sold, and now boasts a community of 50+ collectors.</p>

          <p>Web development work for a tech policy organization during my first two years at Ohio State. I built out their 2022-2024 websites using mostly WordPress with some additional work in PHP, HTML/CSS, and a pipeline in Java that converted large amounts of data in excel into web content. I also authored training materials for future webmasters.</p>
